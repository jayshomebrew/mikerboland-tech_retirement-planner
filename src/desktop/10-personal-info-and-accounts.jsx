              The <strong>Future $ / Today's $</strong> switch at the top of every page chooses the yardstick, not the plan. <em>Future dollars</em> is
              what the engine computes — the actual number of dollars in the account in that year, inflation
              included. <em>Today's dollars</em> restates the same plan in current purchasing power, so
              $3M forty years out reads as what it would buy now. Nothing about the projection changes:
              contributions, taxes, RMDs and IRMAA are all computed on nominal figures because that is how the
              law indexes them, and only the displayed amounts are converted, at your inflation rate of{' '}
              {(((localInfo.inflationRate ?? 0.03) * 100)).toFixed(1)}%. Taxes &amp; Roth, Current Year and Monte

              <strong>Heirs' tax rate</strong> is the ordinary rate whoever inherits your pre-tax accounts is
              assumed to pay. Under the SECURE Act a non-spouse beneficiary has ten years to drain an
              inherited traditional IRA, at their own rates — so a pre-tax dollar is not worth a Roth dollar
              to them. Every "after-tax legacy" figure in the app discounts pre-tax balances by this rate;
              Roth and brokerage pass at face value (brokerage basis steps up at death). It does not change
              any tax you pay while alive.

              The retirement <strong>month</strong> is the month the paycheck stops. Choose July and the
              retirement year carries six months of salary — with the FICA and 401(k) deferrals that come with
              it — plus six months of any pension that starts that year, and the portfolio only has to cover
              what is left. That is usually the year with the least predictable tax bill, and the month is what
              makes it predictable. January means fully retired for the whole year, which is what the plan
              assumed before this field existed.

                  If the RMD exceeds your spending needs, the excess (after paying taxes) is transferred to your brokerage account.
                  The "Withdrawal" column shows total portfolio withdrawals needed to meet your desired income.
                  When RMD &gt; Withdrawal needed, the difference becomes "Excess → Brok".
