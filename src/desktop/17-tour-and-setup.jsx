// ============================================
// GUIDED TOUR — post-setup orientation
//
// The SetupWizard gets the user's DATA in. This gets the user oriented in the
// app that data lands in: 13 tabs of analysis with no explanation of which one
// answers which question. Runs once automatically after setup, then stays
// available from the sidebar.
//
// Deliberately shell-only: every step points at the sidebar or a utility
// button, never at content inside a tab. That keeps the tour from breaking
// whenever a tab's internals get rearranged, and means it never has to switch
// tabs — so no projection recompute is triggered mid-tour.
//
// Seen-state lives under its OWN localStorage key rather than in the plan blob,
// so it can't collide with SCHEMA_VERSION migrations, isn't carried between
// machines by an import/export, and isn't reset by "Clear My Data" — having
// taken the tour is a property of this browser, not of the plan.
// ============================================

// for this reader), Sensitivity (an analyst's tornado chart), AI Assistant
